        <h2>Welcome to our Web Application Programming and Hacking Course and its overview</h2>
        <h3> Course Overview:</h3>
        <p>In this course, students will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
    <hr>    <h3>LAB-0 :</h3>
        <p>This lab covers foundational things managing repositories, version control, and testing Apache servers. I also completed duties including creating SSH public keys for secure authentication, managing private repositories, and cloning repositories over HTTPS and SSH. Lastly, I demonstrated my proficiency with collaborative software development by locally editing a README file and successfully uploading it to the remote GitHub repository, all the while using the 'git pull' command to update my local workspace with changes made remotely.</p>
    <hr>   <h3>LAB-1 :</h3>
        <p>Lab 1 covers the HTTP protocol, the Web, and the fundamentals of web application development. I became acquainted with the HTTP protocol and the Wireshark program in the first section by looking at HTTP streams, requests, and responses. This required utilizing Wireshark to capture network data, examining headers, and comprehending HTTP communication flow. Furthermore, I sent a small amount of HTTP requests using telnet and used Wireshark to examine the messages that came back, identifying variations between requests made through telnet and those made through a browser. In the second section, I went further into the fundamentals of web application development and made straightforward PHP and CGI web apps. These projects required creating, assembling, and implementing PHP and CGI applications, displaying expertise in both HTTP and server-side programming. I had practical exposure to basic web technologies and tools throughout the lab, which was helpful for my future research into web development and security.</p>
    <hr>    <h3>LAB-2 :</h3>
        <p>In Lab 2 covered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, emphasizing practical applications. I became proficient in JavaScript and CSS, both internal and external, and realized how important they are to the creation of dynamic content and styling. I also looked at the Document Object Model (DOM), which makes it possible for dynamic web content to change in response to user input. In addition, I studied client-server communication using Ajax and jQuery, which improved my comprehension of dynamic user interfaces and asynchronous data exchange. I improved my ability to create interactive web apps via hands-on practice, and I learned how to use Chrome Developer Tools to understand HTTP requests and answers. While Task 2 concentrated on integrating Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web API to improve web functionality and user experience, Task 1 required constructing simple HTML forms and integrating JavaScript for dynamic content modification. All things considered, Lab 2 gave me invaluable practical knowledge with the principles of web programming and client-server communication.</p>
    <hr>    <h3>HACKATHON-1:</h3>
        <p>This hackathon provided me with a full understanding of XSS techniques, including both attacks and 
            defensive strategies. I understand the different attack vectors, such as Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, and 
            DOM-based XSS, and how they can be carried out via input fields, URLs, or HTTP headers. I am skilled in 
            identifying the possible effect of XSS attacks, ranging from session hijacking to website defacement. In 
            addition, I've looked at preventive measures including input validation, output encoding, and the use of 
            security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP). My knowledge extends to both client-side and server side languages, allowing you to traverse XSS vulnerabilities regardless of technological stack. With this understanding, I am well-equipped to efficiently identify and remediate XSS vulnerabilities, assuring 
            security and integrity.</p>
    <hr>    <h3>PROJECT-1:</h3>
        <p>The first project involves creating and launching a polished personal website on GitHub Pages that highlights the applicant's qualifications, experiences, educational background, and talents. Utilizing an open-source CSS framework such as Bootstrap guarantees a well-polished and adaptable design that complies with industry norms. A special website introducing the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and associated projects is also necessary since it demonstrates efficient communication and planning. One must demonstrate a grasp of audience engagement and optimization by focusing on prospective employers and including page monitoring for analytics. Moreover, several JavaScript features are included, such as email show/hide functionality, digital and analog clocks, and the incorporation of text and graphics public APIs for dynamic content. JavaScript cookies must be used in order to customize the user experience, and it covered both technical and non-technical requirements.</p>
